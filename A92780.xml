            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FIrst,</hi> as in dutie we ought, We Protest to our great Lord and Master <hi>(his Most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majestie)</hi> That it was an Act of our own free voluntarie disposition, not all, or any of us called or invited by the Parliament or Citisens of <hi>London,</hi> but came as well to protect <hi>White-hall,</hi> had his Majestie been there, as the Parliament house: but a rumour being spread
<pb facs="tcp:112785:3"/> amongst us, that great Court was in feare to be dissovled, and knowing too well the happinesse of this Kingdome consists in their Sessions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the words of Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> a Martyr of ever blessed memory, which were;</p>
            <p>Woe be to <hi>England</hi> when there is no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we seeing and hearing the whole City to be in compleat arms, presently turned fresh-water soldiers, and with as sudden expedition as we could attended by water there progresse thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and joyned our thunder of powder with the City Muskets, at there entrance into the house (the Temple of our safety) to the terrour wee hope of all Papists, and the Lands enemies, who wish for nothing more then the dissolution of both houses. Whose harmony (if they proceed) will be to our perpetuall good, and their sudden Confusion.</p>
            <p>We who are alwayes abroad, can best tell no government upon the Earth is comparable to it; especially, for the keeping of a Crown upon a Kings head, for the procuration of the Subjects Loyaltie, and unfeigned fidelity to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, for the flourishing of Traffique and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing (this Kingdoms right-hand) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of all, which is, was, and necessarily must be by <hi>Parliaments.</hi>

This confusion is that alone which glads the hearts of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, and makes them fat with laughter: while we sit and sit but effect nothing: Yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Conception is long, the birth will be the nobler, and that which <hi>Rome</hi> with all her curses shall not blast, we mean, the firme esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of our <hi>Protestant Religion:</hi> in defence of which chiefly, we display our Colours on the seas, and expose each drop of bloud we have, to hourly danger; and all in behalf of our good and most gracious King, who is himself the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of our Faith.</p>
            <p>Now to the Citie we manifest our selves, and the occasion of our conflux, although we are a sort of people in this Commonwealth, which by the Preciser sort of you, are defined but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle different from Atheists; and therfore should breed more wonder we should stickle for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Be pleased to understand although we have no Churches, we say our prayers as well as you, and the same God you have at shore is ours at sea: whom we wil serve although not so decently as we would, being for the most part of our dais restrained from a Church, to dwell upon the seas for your better security; for be it well known to you, your safety consists in ours, your churches I and your houses too, would quickly fall and
<pb facs="tcp:112785:4"/> lie in the dust, should we let passe <hi>Those</hi> who long to prey upon your lives and Fortunes: But for our Religion, King, and Country, (we do) will advance our Colours against the world: and for a Confirmation to you all of our true hearts, we have all Protested in this manner.</p>
